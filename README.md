# starter-react-nest

**The boring parts, done once.**

A fullstack monorepo starter with React, NestJS, Prisma and Postgres.<br>
Built so every project starts from the same solid ground, and ships faster with AI.

> **Work in progress.** The backend skeleton is ready. The web app, shared package, auth and CI are next. See the [roadmap](#roadmap).

## Why this exists

Every new project used to start the same way: a day or two of wiring up folders, configs, database, testing and linting, slightly differently each time. This starter makes those decisions once, so a new project can go straight to building features.

It's also built for AI-driven development. A consistent structure, strict types and clear conventions give coding agents a pattern to follow instead of one to invent.

## What's inside

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| **Monorepo** | pnpm workspaces + Turborepo, with cached and ordered tasks |
| **API** | NestJS 12 on ESM, tested with Vitest |
| **Database** | Prisma 7 with a multi-file schema, Postgres 18 in Docker |
| **Validation** | Zod, for env config today and shared schemas soon |
| **Linting** | Oxlint, type-aware |
| **Web** | React + Vite *(coming)* |

## Quick start

**You'll need:** Node 24 (see `.nvmrc`), pnpm 10, and Docker Desktop running.

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/akinurrahman/starter-react-nest.git
cd starter-react-nest
pnpm install

# 2. Create your local env file
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env

# 3. Start Postgres
docker compose up -d

# 4. Create the database tables
pnpm --filter @starter/api db:deploy

# 5. Start everything
pnpm dev
```

That's it. The API is running at **http://localhost:8000**.

<details>
<summary><b>Port 5432 already in use?</b></summary>

<br>

If a local Postgres or another project's database is already on 5432, move this one to a different port:

1. Create a `.env` in the repo root with `DB_PORT=5433`
2. In `apps/api/.env`, change the port in `DATABASE_URL` to `5433`
3. Run `docker compose up -d` again

</details>

## Commands

Run everything from the repo root. Turbo runs each task in every app that has it, in the right order, and skips work that hasn't changed.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pnpm dev` | Start all apps in watch mode |
| `pnpm build` | Build all apps for production |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Check types across the repo |
| `pnpm lint` | Lint with Oxlint |
| `pnpm test` | Run unit tests |
| `pnpm test:e2e` | Run end-to-end tests *(needs the database running)* |

**Database**

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pnpm --filter @starter/api db:migrate` | Create and apply a migration after a schema change |
| `pnpm --filter @starter/api db:deploy` | Apply existing migrations, without creating new ones |
| `pnpm --filter @starter/api db:studio` | Browse and edit data in your browser |

## Project structure

│       ├── prisma/

│       │   ├── models/            one .prisma file per domain

```

**`apps/`** holds things you run and deploy. **`packages/`** holds code shared between them, like Zod schemas and types.

## Conventions

- **Naming.** Prisma models and fields are camelCase, mapped to snake_case tables and columns in Postgres.
- **One schema file per domain.** `user.prisma`, `leave.prisma`, `payroll.prisma`, each holding its related models.
- **Migrations are permanent.** Always committed, never edited once they've run outside your machine. Need a change? Make a new migration.
- **Config is validated.** The API refuses to start if an env variable is missing or wrong, and tells you exactly which one.
- **Secrets stay out of git.** Only `.env.example` files are committed.

## Roadmap

- [x] Monorepo with pnpm and Turborepo
- [x] NestJS API on ESM with Vitest
- [x] Prisma 7 and Postgres in Docker
- [x] Validated environment config
- [ ] Request validation, error handling, logging, Swagger, health check
- [ ] Shared package for schemas and types
- [ ] React web app
- [ ] Auth and the users module
- [ ] Repo-wide tooling and CI
- [ ] Init script to set up a new project in one command
